Program 2:

Basketball season is among us! Let’s create a quick graphical basketball application.

1. Create another frame. http://pastebin.com/yKwSQUJ5

2. Next, create a JPanel, and inside of it, you are going to display some basketball information (again feel free to change the class name). http://pastebin.com/GxVKpY7M

3. Set the height of the panel to 400.

4. Set the width of the panel to 550.

5. Your panel should first display an image of something related to basketball.

6. You should be able to add a location.

7. You should be able to add the player’s name.

8. You should be able to set the current ticket price. Use a textbox for this.

9. Once you set these items, click on the button and your program should display the ticket price in dollars and Canadian dollars along with the location.

10. When the button is pushed, all the text fields should be disabled as well. Extra credit: Use a layout manager to make all your information show up an organized way. Have the image change whenever the button is clicked to random images.
